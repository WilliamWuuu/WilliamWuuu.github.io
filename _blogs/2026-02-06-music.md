Below are a few albums I kept returning to in 2025. I’m sharing short notes and embedded Spotify players so you can listen right here.

## 1) Ambient focus — *Music for Airports*
This one helped me get through long writing sessions and late‑night debugging. Minimal, airy, and endlessly replayable.

<div class="spotify-embed">
  <iframe 
    style="border-radius:12px" 
    src="https://open.spotify.com/embed/album/2fY1v2KZ3QXr8bJH8dS9qE?utm_source=generator" width="100%" 
    height="352" 
    frameBorder="0" 
    allowfullscreen="" 
    allow="autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; fullscreen; picture-in-picture" loading="lazy">
  </iframe>
</div>

If you want the embed to look narrower or more compact, I can switch some to the smaller player height (e.g., 152px).
